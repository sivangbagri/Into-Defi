- State variables are varibales stored on blockchain, declared inside a contract outside the function .
- Variables inside the function are local variables, destroyed after function execution.
- global variables :  msg.sender , block.number, block.timestamp

- using constant with state variables reduces gas fee.
- lower is the number of loops in function lower is the gas fee.
- Whenever error (require, revert, assert)  id thrown gas is refunded , state variable changes are reverted
- Using custom error is cheaper to use.
- constructor : special func : called once when contract deployed : used to declare state variables.
- Data stored in memory exists only for the duration of a function call.
- memory variables are not written to the blockchain.
- When passing or returning dynamic data types like arrays, strings, or structs, you can use memory to indicate they are temporary.
- For arrays, strings, and structs, you must explicitly declare the data location (memory, storage, or calldata).
- memory arrays cannot be initialized with a literal array directly.
- removing ele from a array : (a) left shifting and pop last ele (more gas preserve order) (b)  ele to be removed = last and pop (less gas unpreserved order) 
- we cannot get the size of mapping and also we cannot iterate over mapping.
