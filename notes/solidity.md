- State variables are varibales stored on blockchain, declared inside a contract outside the function .
- Variables inside the function are local variables, destroyed after function execution.
- global variables :  msg.sender , block.number, block.timestamp

- using constant with state variables reduces gas fee.
- lower is the number of loops in function lower is the gas fee.
- Whenever error (require, revert, assert)  id thrown gas is refunded , state variable changes are reverted
- Using custom error is cheaper to use.
- constructor : special func : called once when contract deployed : used to declare state variables.
- Data stored in memory exists only for the duration of a function call.
- memory variables are not written to the blockchain.
- When passing or returning dynamic data types like arrays, strings, or structs, you can use memory to indicate they are temporary.
- For arrays, strings, and structs, you must explicitly declare the data location (memory, storage, or calldata).
- memory arrays cannot be initialized with a literal array directly.
- removing ele from a array : (a) left shifting and pop last ele (more gas preserve order) (b)  ele to be removed = last and pop (less gas unpreserved order) 
- we cannot get the size of mapping and also we cannot iterate over mapping.
- when we use a dynamic datatype as a variable we need to declare its data location :storage , memory, calldata
- use storage to update the data , memory for reading the data , for function input use calldata (Saves gas avoid copying)
- calldata is immutable. If you need to modify the data, use memory instead.
- Events are primarily used to communicate with the front end of a decentralized application (DApp) or to record important activities within a contract.
- it allows off-chain tools (e.g., Web3.js, Ethers.js, or blockchain explorers like Etherscan) to search for specific events based on the values of those indexed fields.
- virtual is used to specify that this fucntion can be inherited and modified by the child contract.
- order of inheritance (in multiple inheritance) : most  base-like to derived 
- if inherited and parent has constructor the child has to specifiy params.
- calling parent function : by direct calling , or using **super**

- This interface allows the CallInterface contract to interact with any contract that implements the ICounter interface, without needing to know its internal details.

- Libraries cannot store state variables or accept Ether; If functions are internal, they are embedded directly into the contract that uses them, saving gas.
- Library enhances datatype.
- keccak256 Used in Ethereum for address generation, signatures, and data integrity checks.

- The abi.encodePacked function compresses the input, whereas abi.encode adds type information and padding.
- For constants or fixed strings, use keccak256("ADMIN") as it's simpler and cheaper in gas.
- For dynamic values or concatenations, use keccak256(abi.encodePacked(...)) for flexibility.
- mappings in Solidity are always stored in storage by default
- create2 is used to deploy other contracts with a predictable address.(CREATE2 is an opcode)
- staticcall is a low-level function used to call other contracts or functions without modifying the state of the blockchain (target contract's). It is used for read-only operations.
- using multiCall function call is that they are processed one after another in the same transaction.
- gas saving techniques 
    - use calldata  
    - load state variable into memory
    - short circuit 
    - loop increment : ++i âœ…
    - cache array length
    - loop  array elements to memory

- In DeFi, vaults are smart contracts that manage ERC-20 tokens for yield farming, lending, borrowing, or collateralization.
- An Automated Market Maker (AMM) in DeFi (Decentralized Finance) is a protocol that allows users to trade cryptocurrencies in a decentralized manner using liquidity pools instead of traditional order books.
